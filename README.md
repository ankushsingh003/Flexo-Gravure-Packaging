## � Core Innovations

### ✨ Immersive 3D Ecosystem
- **Velocity-Based Physics**: The background features 3D geometries that float, rotate, and interact with the user's mouse.
- **Anti-Clustering Intelligence**: Objects maintain spatial awareness, preventing clumping and ensuring a balanced visual field.
- **Crystal UI Architecture**: A unique glassmorphism design with 0.15 opacity and semantic backdrop filters that allows the 3D world to shine through the entire page.
- **Cosmic Data Dust**: A custom particle system of 2000+ stars creating an infinite depth sensation.

### 🛠️ Advanced Learning Tools
- **Course-Specific Notes**: A smart PDF delivery system that provides tailored resources based on the active course path.
- **Academic Integration**: Direct pipelines to Google Scholar for deep-dive research into Flexo and Gravure papers.
- **Smart Navigation**: A dynamic navbar that evolves its options (Notes, Research) based on the user's current learning context.
- **Click Spark FX**: Custom interactive micro-animations for enhanced tactile engagement.
